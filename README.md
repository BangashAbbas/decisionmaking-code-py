# decisionmaking-code-py

*Original Julia Code by: Mykel Kochenderfer, Tim Wheeler, and Kyle Wray*
*Python Versions by: Griffin Holt*

Python versions of all typeset code blocks from the book, [Algorithms for Decision Making](https://algorithmsbook.com/).

I share this content in the hopes that it helps you and makes the decision making algorithms more approachable and accessible (especially to those not as familiar with Julia). Thank you for reading!

If you encounter any issues or have pressing comments, please file an issue. (There are likely to still be bugs as I have not finished testing all of the classes and functions.)

**Progress Update: (22 Mar 2023)**
*   All typeset code blocks through Chapter 8
*   Selected examples and exercises through Chapter 7
